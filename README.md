Real_Time_Twitter_Analysis_Dashboard

Dashboard created In training period is at https://github.com/krishnazawar26/Twitter_Dashboard

Tasks:-

1. Build a pie chart that represents the proportion of total clicks (URL clicks, user profile clicks, and hashtag clicks) for tweets with more than 500 impressions. Include a drill-down to view the specific types of clicks for each tweet

2. Create a clustered bar chart that breaks down the sum of URL clicks, user profile clicks, and hashtag clicks by tweet category (e.g., tweets with media, tweets with links, tweets with hashtags). Only include tweets that have at least one of these interaction types and this graph should work only between 3PM IST to 5 PM IST apart from that time we should not show this graph in dashboard itself and the tweet date should be even number as well as tweet word count be above 40.

3. Create a line chart showing the trend of the average engagement rate over each month of the year. Separate the lines for tweets with media content and those without and this graph should work only between 3PM IST to 5 PM IST and 7 AM to 11AM apart from that time we should not show this graph in dashboard itself and the tweet engagement should be even number and tweet date should be odd number as well as tweet character count should be above 20 and need to remove tweet word which has letter 'C'.
